# Region-specific evaluation configuration
# Enables detailed analysis of model performance across antibody regions

# Master switch - enable region-specific evaluation
enabled: true

# Evaluation mode:
# - "standard": Uses existing eval masking, computes metrics on masked positions in regions (fast)
# - "per-position": Mask one position at a time, aggregate by region (most detailed, slow)
# - "region-level": Mask entire regions at once (tests region reconstruction)
mode: "per-position"

# Batch size for per-position evaluation
# Higher values = faster but more memory
position_batch_size: 32
