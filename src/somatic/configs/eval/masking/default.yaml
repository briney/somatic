# Evaluation masking configuration
# Controls how sequences are masked during evaluation for reproducible comparisons

# Masker type: "uniform" or "information_weighted"
# - uniform: Random masking with equal probability for all valid positions
# - information_weighted: Biased toward CDR and non-templated regions
type: uniform

# Mask rate (0.0-1.0)
mask_rate: 0.15

# Weight multipliers for information-weighted masking
# Only used when type=information_weighted
# Higher values = stronger preference for masking those positions
cdr_weight_multiplier: 1.0         # Weight boost for CDR positions
nongermline_weight_multiplier: 1.0  # Weight boost for nongermline positions

# Selection method for information-weighted masking
# Only used when type=information_weighted
# - "ranked": Deterministic top-K selection
# - "sampled": Probabilistic Gumbel-top-k sampling (recommended)
selection_method: sampled

# Random seed for reproducible masking
# Same seed + same data = same masked positions
seed: 42
